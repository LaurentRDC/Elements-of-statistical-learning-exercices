???+ question "Ex. 5.19"
    Show that the Haar wavelet transform of a signal of length $N=2^J$ can be computed in $O(N)$ computations.

??? done "Soln. 5.19"
    We refer to Section 2.1 in \cite{nason2008wavelet} for readers interested in the pyramidal technique for Haar wavelet transform. Here we give a high level idea on why the time complexity is $O(N)$.

	Given a discrete sequence of data $y=(y_1,y_2,...,y_N)$, without loss of generality, we assume that $N=2^J$ for some integer $J\ge 0$, the pyramidal technique consists of $J$ steps, in each step, we calculate
	
    \begin{eqnarray}
	      d_{j, k} = \frac{1}{\sqrt {2}} ( c_{j+1, 2k} - c_{j+1, 2k-1} )\non\\
	      c_{j, k} = \frac{1}{\sqrt {2}} ( c_{j+1, 2k} + c_{j+1, 2k-1} )\non
	\end{eqnarray}  
	
    for $j=J-1,...,0$ and $k=1,...,2^{j}$. Let $c_{J, k} = y_k$ for initialization. At $j$-th step, the time complexity is $2 * 2^j=2^{j+1}$, therefore the total time complexity is
	
    \begin{equation}
		\sum_{j=0}^{J-1}2^{j+1} = 2(2^J-1) = 2(N-1).\non 
	\end{equation}
	
    Thus the complexity is $O(N)$.
