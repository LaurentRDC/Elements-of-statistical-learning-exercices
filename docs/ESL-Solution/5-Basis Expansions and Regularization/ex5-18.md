???+ question "Ex. 5.18"
    The wavelet function $\psi(x)$ of the symmlet-$p$ wavelet basis has vanishing moments up to order $p$. Show that this implies that polynomials of order $p$ are represented exactly in $V_0$, defined on page 176.

??? done "Soln. 5.18"
    The expansion of a function $f(x)$ in symmlet-$p$ wavelet basis has the form
	
    \begin{equation}
		f(x) = \sum_{m,n}f_{mn}\psi_{mn}(x)\non
	\end{equation}
	
    where 
	
    \begin{equation}
		f_{mn} := \int f(x)\psi_{mn}(x)dx.\non
	\end{equation}

	The constraint on the moments
	
    \begin{equation}
		\int \psi(x)x^ldx = 0, \ \ l=0,...,p-1\non
	\end{equation}
	
    has important consequences. First it implies
	
    \begin{eqnarray}
	    &&\int \psi_{0m}(x)x^ldx = \int \psi(x-m)x^ldx = \int \psi(y)(y+m)^ldy\non\\
	    &=&\sum_{k=0}^l\frac{l!}{k!(l-k)!}\int \psi(y)y^kdy=0, \ \  l=0,...,p-1,\non 
	\end{eqnarray}
	
    which means that the first $p-1$ moments of the unit translates of the mother wavelet function vanish. Second, changing scales gives
	
    \begin{eqnarray}
	    &&\int \psi_{10}(x)x^l = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\int \psi(x/2)x^ldx\non\\
	    &=&2^{l+1/2}\int \psi(y)y^ldy=0,\ \ l=0,...,p-1.\non 
	\end{eqnarray}
	
    It's easy to proceed inductively to show for all $m$ and $n$ that
	
    \begin{equation}
		\int \psi_{nm}(x)x^ldx = 0,\ \  l=0,...,p-1.\non
	\end{equation}

	This means that every symmlet-$p$ wavelet basis function is orthogonal to all polynomials of degree less than $p$. Therefore we see the polynomials of degrees less than $p$ can be represented exactly by the finite linear combination of the scaling functions $\phi(x-k)$, which spans the *reference* space $V_0$.
