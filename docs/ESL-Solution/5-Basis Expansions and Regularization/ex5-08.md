???+ question "Ex. 5.8"
    In the appendix to this chapter we show how the smoothing spline computations could be more efficiently carried out using a $(N + 4)$ dimensional basis of B-splines. Describe a slightly simpler scheme using a $(N +2)$ dimensional B-spline basis defined on the $N-2$ interior knots.

    I believe the relevant text is in the last section of Appendix in Chapter 5. The use of B-splines reduces the complexity from $O(N^3)$ to $O(N)$ via Cholesky decomposition of a 4-banded matrix $(\textbf{B}^T\textbf{B}+\lambda \bm{\Omega})$. It seems to me, using $(N+2)$ dimensional B-splines yields $\textbf{B}\in \mathbb{R}^{N\times (N+2)}$ and $\bm{\Omega}\in\mathbb{R}^{(N+2)\times (N+2)}$, which is slightly simpler than $N\times (N+4)$ and $(N+4)\times (N+4)$ matrices, however it's unclear to me what the essential differences are.
