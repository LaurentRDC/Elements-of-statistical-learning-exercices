???+ question "Ex. 5.5"
    Write a program to classify the *phoneme* data using a quadratic discriminant analysis (Section 4.3). Since there are many correlated features, you should filter them using a smooth basis of natural cubic splines (Section 5.2.3). Decide beforehand on a series of five different choices for the number and position of the knots, and use tenfold cross-validation to make the final selection. The phoneme data are available from the book [website](www-stat.stanford.edu/ElemStatLearn).
