???+ question "Ex. 5.12"
    Characterize the solution to the following problem,
	
    \begin{equation}
	\label{eq:5-12w}
		\min_f\text{RSS}(f,\lambda) = \sum_{i=1}^N\omega_i\{y_i-f(x_i)\}^2 + \lambda\int \{f''(t)^2\}dt,
	\end{equation}
	
    where the $\omega_i\ge 0$ are observation weights.

	Characterize the solution to the smoothing spline problem (5.9) when the training data have ties in $X$.

??? done "Soln. 5.12"
    Following the same arguments in [Ex. 5.7](ex5-07.md), the solution to $\eqref{eq:5-12w}$ is a cubic spline with knots at the unique values of $\{x_i, i=1,...,N\}$ and fitted spline can be represented as
	
    \begin{equation}
		\hat f(x) = \sum_{j=1}^NN_j(x_j)\hat \theta_j\non
	\end{equation}
	
    where
	
    \begin{equation}
		\hat \theta = (\bb{N}^T\bb{W}\bb{N} + \lambda\bm{\Omega}_N)^{-1}\bb{N}^T\bb{W}\bb{y}\non
	\end{equation}
	
    and $\bb{W} = \text{diag}(\omega_1, ..., \omega_n)$.

	Suppose we group all the training data into $n$ groups. Each group $i$ contains $n_i\ge 1$ training data which have the same $x_i$ and let $\bar y_i$ be their $y_i$'s average. So the first summand in (5.9) can be rewritten as 
	
    \begin{eqnarray}
	    &&\sum_{i=1}^n\sum_{j\in n_i}(y_j-f(x_i))^2\non\\
	    &=&\sum_{i=1}^n\sum_{j\in n_i}(y_j-\bar y_i + \bar y_i - f(x_i))^2\non\\
	    &=&\sum_{i=1}^n\sum_{j\in n_i}[(y_j-\bar y_i)^2  + (\bar y_i - f(x_i))^2 + 2(y_j-\bar y_i)(\bar y_i - f(x_i))]\non
	\end{eqnarray}

	Note that
	
    \begin{equation}
		\sum_{i=1}^n\sum_{j\in n_i} (\bar y_i - f(x_i))^2 = \sum_{i=1}^n n_i(\bar y_i - f(x_i))^2,\non
	\end{equation}
	
    and
	
    \begin{equation}
		\sum_{i=1}^n\sum_{j\in n_i}(y_j-\bar y_i)(\bar y_i - f(x_i)) = 0\non
	\end{equation}
	
    and $\sum_{i=1}^n\sum_{j\in n_i}(y_j-\bar y_i)^2$ is independent of $f$. So minimizing (5.9) in text is equivalent to minimizing
	
    \begin{equation}
		\sum_{i=1}^nn_i(\bar y_i - f(x_i))^2 + \lambda\int{f''(t)}^2dt,\non
	\end{equation}
	
    which is treated by the first half of this problem.
