???+ question "Ex. 5.6"
    Suppose you wish to fit a periodic function, with a known period $T$. Describe how you could modify the truncated power series basis to achieve this goal.

??? done "Soln. 5.6"
    If the period $T$ is known, without loss of generality, the problem reduces to use truncated power series on domain $[0, T]$. For $x\in \mathbb{R}$, it's easy to map it to $x^\ast\in [0,T]$ such that $f(x) = f(x^\ast)$.

	Alternatively, we could consider Fourier basis for periodic function.
