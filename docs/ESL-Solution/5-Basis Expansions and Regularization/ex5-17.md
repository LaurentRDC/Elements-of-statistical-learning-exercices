???+ question "Ex. 5.17"
    Show how to convert the discrete eigen-decomposition of $\bb{K}$ in Section 5.8.2 to estimates of the eigenfunctions of $K$.

??? done "Soln. 5.17"
    As the text suggests, given a kernel matrix $\bb{K}$, we first calculate its eigen-decomposition
	
    \begin{equation}
		\bb{K} = \bm{\Phi}\bb{D}_\lambda\bm{\Phi}^T.\non
	\end{equation}
	
    Then $i-$th row of $\bm{\Phi}$ is the estimated vector of basis functions $\phi(x_i)$, evaluated at point $x_i$.
