???+ question "Ex. 17.10"
	Using a simple binary graphical model with just two variables, show why it is essential to include a constant node $X_0\equiv 1$ in the model.

??? done "Soln. 17.10"
	Suppose we only have two variables $X_1$ and $X_2$. When $X_1$ and $X_2$ are not connected, the joint probability in (17.28) reduces to a constant 1. When a constant node $X_0\equiv 1$ is included and is always connected to $X_1$ and $X_2$, then the join probability becomes
	
    \begin{eqnarray}
		p(\bb{X},\bm{\Theta}) &=& \exp\left(\theta_{01}X_1+\theta_{02}X_2 - \log\left(\exp(\theta_{01}) + \exp(\theta_{02} + \exp(\theta_{01} + \theta_{02}))\right)\right)\non\\
		&=&\exp\left(\theta_{01}X_1 + \theta_{02}X_2\right)/[1+\exp(\theta_{01})+\exp(\theta_{02}) + \exp(\theta_{01} + \theta_{02})].\non
	\end{eqnarray}
