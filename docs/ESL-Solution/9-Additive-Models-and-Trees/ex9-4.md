???+ question "Ex. 9.4"
    Suppose the same smoother $\bb{S}$ is used to estimate both terms in a two-term additive model (i.e., both variables are identical). Assume that $\bb{S}$ is symmetric with eigenvalues in $[0,1)$. Show that the backfitting residual converges to $(\bb{I} + \bb{S})^{-1}(\bb{I}-\bb{S})\by$, and that the residual sum of squares converges upward. Can the residual sum of squares converge upward in less structured situations? How does this fit compare to the fit with a single term fit by $\bb{S}$? 
    
    [*Hint*: Use the eigen-decomposition of $\bb{S}$ to help with this comparison.]

    This follows directly from [Ex. 9.2](ex9-2.md), where the fitted values are both shown to be $(\bb{I}-\bb{S}^2)^{-1}(\bb{S}-\bb{S}^2)\by$. Then, the residual is 

	\begin{eqnarray}
		\by - 2(\bb{I}-\bb{S}^2)^{-1}(\bb{S}-\bb{S}^2)\by
		&=&(\bb{I}-\bb{S}^2)^{-1}[(\bb{I}-\bb{S}^2)\by - 2(\bb{S}-\bb{S}^2)\by]\non\\
		&=&(\bb{I}-\bb{S}^2)^{-1}(\bb{I} - \bb{S})^2\by\non\\
		&=&(\bb{I}+\bb{S})^{-1}(\bb{I}-\bb{S})\by.\non
	\end{eqnarray}
	
	Consider the eigen-decomposition of $\bb{S}$ (e.g., (5.19) in the text), 
	
    \begin{equation}
		\bb{S} = \sum_{k=1}^N\rho_k\bb{u}_k\bb{u}_k^T,\non
	\end{equation}
	
    with $\rho_k\in [0,1)$.
	Then the residual can be rewritten as 
	
    \begin{equation}
		\sum_{k=1}^N\bb{u}_k\frac{1-\rho_k}{1+\rho_k}\bb{u}_k^T\by.\non
	\end{equation}
	
    If we use a single term fit by $\bb{S}$, the residual is simply $(\bb{I}-\bb{S})\by$ and is rewritten as 
	
    \begin{equation}
		\sum_{k=1}^N\bb{u}_k(1-\rho_k)\bb{u}_k^T\by.\non
	\end{equation}
	
    We see that two-term fit has less residuals compared to one-term fit, which is expected intuitively.
