???+ question "Ex. 18.17"
	*Equivalence between Benjaminiâ€“Hochberg and plug-in methods.*

	(a) In the notation of Algorithm 18.2, show that for rejection threshold $p_0=p_{(L)}$, a proportion of at most $p_0$ of the permuted values $t_j^k$ exceed $|T|_{(L)}$ where $|T|_{(L)}$ is the $L$th largest value among the $|t_j|$. Hence show that the plug-in FDR estimate $\widehat{\text{FDR}}$ is less than or equal to $p_0\cdot M/L = \alpha$.
	
    (b) Show that the cut-point $|T|_{(L+1)}$ produces a test with estimated FDR greater than $\alpha$.

??? done "Soln. 18.17"
    (a) Note that $p_{(1)} \le p_{(2)} \le \cdots \le p_{(M)}$ and the definition of $p_j$ in (18.41), we know $p_{(L)}$ corresponds to $T_{(L)}$, that is,
	
    \begin{equation}
		p_0 = p_{(L)} = \frac{1}{MK}\sum_{j' = 1}^M \sum_{k=1}^K \bb{I}(|t_{j'}^k| > t_{(L)}).\non
	\end{equation}
	
    Therefore, the proportion of the permuted values $t_j^k$ exceed $|T|_{(L)}$ is at most $p_0$.

	Recall (18.46) in Algorithm 18.3, we have 
	
    \begin{eqnarray}
		\widehat{\text{FDR}} &=& \frac{\widehat{E(V)}}{R_{\text{obs}}}\non\\
		&=&\frac{\frac{1}{K}\sum_{j=1}^M\sum_{k=1}^K\bb{I}(|t_j^k| > |T|_{(L)})}{\sum_{j=1}^M\bb{I}(|t_j| > |T|_{(L)})}\non\\
		&\le &\frac{p_0\cdot M}{L-1}\non\\
		&=&\alpha. \label{eq:18-17a}
	\end{eqnarray}
	
    Note that the last equality assumes $\alpha = \frac{p_0\cdot M}{L-1}$ instead of $\frac{p_0\cdot M}{L}$ defined in the text. Otherwise I don't see how to prove the claimed result. 

	(b) It follows the same arguments as $\eqref{eq:18-17a}$ by noting the the proportion of the permuted values $t_j^k$ exceed $|T|_{(L+1)}$ is greater than $p_0$.
