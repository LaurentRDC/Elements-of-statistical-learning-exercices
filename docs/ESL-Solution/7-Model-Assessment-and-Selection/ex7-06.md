???+ question "Ex. 7.6"
    Show that for an additive-error model, the effective degrees-of-freedom for the $k$-nearest-neighbors regression fit is $N/k$.

??? done "Soln. 7.6"
    Note that for this $k$-nearest-neighbors model, it's a linear smoother. To see that, note

	\begin{equation}
		\hat Y(x) = \frac{1}{k}\sum_{i: x_i\in N_k(x)}y_i = \frac{1}{k}\sum_{i=1}^N\eta_i y_i\non
	\end{equation} 

    where $\eta_i = 1$ if $x_i\in N_k(x)$ and 0 otherwise.

	So we can write

    \begin{equation}
	  	\hat Y = \frac{1}{k}\bb{S}\bb{y}\non
    \end{equation}  

	in which $\bb{S}$ is a binary matrix with diagonal elements being 1 since the nearest one (itself) must be included in estimation.
	Therefore, the effective df is simply

    \begin{equation}
		\frac{1}{k}\text{trace}(\bb{S}) = \frac{N}{k}.\non
	\end{equation}
