!!! question "Ex. 3.22"
    Show that the solution in [Ex. 3.21](ex3-21.md) does not change if $\Sigma$ is estimated by the more natural quantity $(\bb{Y}-\bb{X}\hat{\bb{B}})^T(\bb{Y}-\bb{X}\hat{\bb{B}})/(N-pK)$.

???+ done "Soln. 3.22"
    Note that in our solution for [Ex. 3.21](ex3-21.md), we don't assume the form of $\Sigma$ so the same arguments applies here.
