> Show how the vector of least squares coefficients can be obtained from a single pass of the Gram-Schmidt procedure (Algorithm 3.1). Represent your solution in terms of the QR decomposition of $\textbf{X}$.

## Solution 3.4

Given the QR decomposition $\textbf{X}=\textbf{Q}\textbf{R}$, we know that (see (3.32) in the text)

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:3-4a}
    \hat\beta = \textbf{R}^{-1}\textbf{Q}^T\textbf{y}.
\end{equation}

Since $\textbf{Q}$ and $\textbf{R}$ are computed from the Gram-Schmidt procedure on $\textbf{X}$, as we are producing $\textbf{q}_k$ for $\textbf{Q}$, we can calculate $\textbf{q}_k^T\textbf{y}$ so that $\textbf{Q}^T\textbf{y}$ is sequentially filled. After $\textbf{R}$ is computed, we can solve $\textbf{R}^{-1}$ in a backward way since its upper triangular. Then we are able to compute $\beta$ as given in $\eqref{eq:3-4a}$.
