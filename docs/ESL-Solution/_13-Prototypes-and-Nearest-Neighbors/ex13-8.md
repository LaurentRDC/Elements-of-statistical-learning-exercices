???+ question "Ex. 13.8"
	Generate data in two classes, with two features. These features are all independent Gaussian variates with standard deviation 1. Their
	mean vectors are $(-1,-1)$ in class 1 and $(1, 1)$ in class 2. To each feature vector apply a random rotation of angle $\theta$, $\theta$ chosen uniformly from 0 to $2\pi$. Generate 50 observations from each class to form the training set, and 500 in each class as the test set. Apply four different classifiers:
	
	(1) Nearest-neighbors.
	
    (2) Nearest-neighbors with hints: ten randomly rotated versions of each data point are added to the training set before applying nearest-neighbors.
	
    (3) Invariant metric nearest-neighbors, using Euclidean distance invariant to rotations about the origin.
	
    (4) Tangent distance nearest-neighbors.

	In each case choose the number of neighbors by tenfold cross-validation. Compare the results.
