???+ question "Ex. 13.2"
    Derive formula (13.7) for the median radius of the 1-nearest-neighborhood.

??? done "Soln. 13.2"
    This exercise is similar to [Ex. 2.3](../2-Overview-of-Supervised-Learning/ex2-3.md).

	Recall $\nu_p r^p$ is the volume of the sphere of radius $r$ in $p$ dimension. Consider the unit cube $[-\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{2}]^p$, and a point $a$ uniformly distributed in it. The probability that $a$ falls outside of the superball $b$ which centers at origin and has radius $0<r<1$ is 
	
    \begin{equation}
	1-\text{volume}(b) = 1- \nu_pr^p.\non	
	\end{equation}
	
    Now for $N$ independently and uniformly distributed data points, the probability of the 1-nearest-neighborhood of origin (i.e., the point that is the closest to the origin) falls outside of the superball is
	
    \begin{equation}
		(1- \nu_pr^p)^N.\non
	\end{equation}
	
    To find the median of $R$ (the radius of a 1-nearest-neighborhood of origin), we set above equal to $\frac{1}{2}$:
	
    \begin{equation}
		(1-\nu_pR^p)^N = \frac{1}{2}.\non
	\end{equation}
	
    Solving for $R$ we get
	
    \begin{equation}
		R = \nu_p^{-1/p}\left(1-\frac{1}{2}^{1/N}\right)^{1/p}.\non
	\end{equation}
