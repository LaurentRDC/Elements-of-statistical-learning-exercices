???+ question "Ex. 6.8"
    Suppose that for continuous response $Y$ and predictor $X$, we model the joint density of $X, Y$ using a multivariate Gaussian kernel estimator. Note that the kernel in this case would be the product kernel $\phi_\lambda(X)\phi_\lambda(Y)$. Show that the conditional mean $E[Y|X]$ derived from this estimate is a Nadaraya-Watson estimator. Extend this result to classification by providing a suitable kernel for the estimation of the joint distribution of a continuous $X$ and discrete $Y$.

    By definition we get
	
    \begin{equation}
		E[Y|X] = \int y f(y|x)dy = \frac{\int y f(x,y)dy}{f(x)}.\non
	\end{equation}
	
    The estimates give (see (6.23) in the text)
	
    \begin{eqnarray}
	    \hat f(x,y) &=& \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N\phi_\lambda(x-x_i)\phi_\lambda(y-y_i)\non\\
	    \hat f(x)   &=& \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N\phi_\lambda(x-x_i).\non
	\end{eqnarray}	
	
    Thus we have
	
    \begin{eqnarray}
	    E[Y|X] &=& \frac{\int y \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N\phi_\lambda(x-x_i)\phi_\lambda(y-y_i) dy}{\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N\phi_\lambda(x-x_i)}\non\\
	    &=&\frac{\sum_{i=1}^N\phi_\lambda(x-x_i)\int y\phi_\lambda(y-y_i)dy}{\sum_{i=1}^N\phi_\lambda(x-x_i)}\non\\
	    &=&\frac{\sum_{i=1}^N\phi_\lambda(x-x_i)y_i}{\sum_{i=1}^N\phi_\lambda(x-x_i)},\label{eq:6-8a}
	\end{eqnarray}
	
    where the last equations follows from
	
    \begin{equation}
		\int y\phi_\lambda(y-y_i)dy = y_i.\non
	\end{equation}

	Now consider the case when $Y$ is discrete. Assume that $Y$ takes values in the set $J\subset Z=\{\cdots, -1, 0, 1, \cdots\}$. If we choose a *naive* frequency estimate for $Y$, then we have
	
    \begin{eqnarray}
	    \hat f(x,i) &=& \hat f(i) \cdot \hat f(x|i)\non\\
	     &=&\frac{N_i}{N}\cdot\frac{1}{N_i}\sum_{l\in C(i)}\phi_\lambda(x-x_l)\non\\
 	     &=&\frac{1}{N}\sum_{l\in C(i)}\phi_\lambda(x-x_l)\non\\	
	    \hat f(x)   &=& \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N\phi_\lambda(x-x_i),\non
	\end{eqnarray}
	
    where $C(i)$ is the set of $X$'s such that the corresponding $Y$'s are in category $i$ and $N_i$ is the size of $C(i)$. Then it's easy to verify that $\eqref{eq:6-8a}$ holds.

	Such estimate can be viewed as the combined kernel for the continuous component with the frequency for the discrete. We can further improve it by a smoothing over the estimate with respect to the discrete component $Y$ using a *discrete window weight function* (see, e.g., [Nonparametric estimation of joint discrete-continuous probability densities with applications](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/0378375894900280)).
