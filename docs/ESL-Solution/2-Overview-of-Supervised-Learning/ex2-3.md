> Derive equation (2.24).

## Solution 2.3

Let $\nu_p\cdot r^p$ be the volume of the sphere of radius $r$ in $p$ dimension. Consider the unit ball and a point $a$ uniformly sampled from it. The probability that $a$ falls outside of the superball $b$ which centers at origin and has radius $0<r<1$ is 

\begin{equation}
\frac{\nu_p\cdot 1^p-\nu_p\cdot r^p}{\nu_p\cdot 1^p} = 1-r^p.\nonumber	
\end{equation}

Now for $N$ independently and uniformly distributed data points, the probability of the point that is the closest to the origin falls outside of the superball $b$ is

\begin{equation}
    (1- r^p)^N.\nonumber
\end{equation}

To find the median of the radius of the closest point of origin, we set the probability above equal to $\frac{1}{2}$:

\begin{equation}
    (1-d(p,N)^p)^N = \frac{1}{2}.\nonumber
\end{equation}

Solving for $d(p,N)$ we get

\begin{equation}
    d(p, N) = \left(1-\frac{1}{2}^{1/N}\right)^{1/p}.\nonumber
\end{equation}
