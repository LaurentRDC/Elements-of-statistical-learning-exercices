> The edge effect problem discussed on page 23 is not peculiar to uniform sampling from bounded domains. Consider inputs drawn from a spherical multinormal distribution $X\sim N(0, \textbf{I}_p)$. The squared distance from any sample point to the origin has a $\chi_p^2$ distribution with mean $p$. Consider a prediction point $x_0$ drawn from this distribution, and let $a=x_0/\|x_0\|$ be an associated unit vector. Let $z_i=a^Tx_i$ be the projection of each of the training points on this direction.
> 
>Show that the $z_i$ are distributed $N(0,1)$ with expected squared distance from origin 1, while the target point has expected squared distance $p$ from the origin.
> Hence for $p=10$, a randomly drawn test point is about 3.1 standard deviations from the origin, while all the training points are on average one standard deviation along direction $a$. So most prediction points see themselves as lying on the edge of the training set.

## Solution 2.4

Since $z_i = a^Tx_i$, $z_i$ is a linear combination of standard normal random variables, thus $z_i$ is normal. It's easy to see that $E[z_i] = 0$ and 

\begin{equation}
    \text{Var}(z_i) = \|a\|^2\text{Var}(x_i) = \text{Var}(x_i) = 1.\nonumber
\end{equation}

There we know $z_i\sim N(0,1)$ and the expected squared distance from origin is just its variance, which is 1. As for the target point $x_t$, its squared distance to origin follows a $\chi_p^2$ distribution and thus has mean $p$.

For $p=10$, we have 

\begin{equation}
    \text{sd}(x_t) = \sqrt{\text{Var}(x_t)} = \sqrt{10} \approx 3.16.\nonumber
\end{equation}

!!!note
    The claim 3.1 in the text is not accurate, it should be 3.2 instead.
