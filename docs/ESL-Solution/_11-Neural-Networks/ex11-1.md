???+ question "Ex. 11.1"    
    Establish the exact correspondence between the projection pursuit regression model (11.1) and the neural network (11.5). In particular, show that the single-layer regression network is equivalent to a PPR model with $g_m(\omega_m^Tx) = \beta_m\sigma(\alpha_{0m}+s_m(\omega_m^Tx))$, where $\omega_m$ is the $m$th unit vector. Establish a similar equivalence for a classification network.

??? done "Soln. 11.1"
    Let $K=1$, from (11.5) we have
	
    
    \begin{eqnarray}
	    f(X) &=& g(T) \non\\
	    &=&g(\beta_0+\beta^TZ)\non\\
	    &=&g(\beta_0 + \sum_{m=1}^M\beta_m\sigma(\alpha_{0m} + \alpha_m^TX)).\non
	\end{eqnarray}
	
    Consider $\beta_0$ added as the bias term into $X$, and assume as usual that $g$ is the identity function, we have
	
    \begin{equation}
		f(X) = \sum_{m=0}^M\beta_m\sigma(\alpha_{0m} + \alpha_m^TX).\non
	\end{equation}
	
    Comparing with (11.1), we have
	
    \begin{equation}
		g_m(\omega_m^TX) = \beta_m\sigma(\alpha_{0m} + \|\alpha_m\|(\omega_m^TX))\non
	\end{equation}
	
    where $\omega_m = \alpha_m/\|\alpha_m\|$.

	For a classification network, let $K > 1$. Assume that (see (11.6) in the text)
	
    \begin{equation}
	 	g_k(T) = \frac{e^{T_k}}{\sum_{l=1}^Ke^{T_l}},\non
	\end{equation} 
	
    by similar calculations above we get
	
    \begin{equation}
	  	f_k(X) = \frac{e^{\sum_{m=0}^M\beta_{mk}\sigma(\alpha_{0m} + \|\alpha_m\|(\omega_m^TX))}}{\sum_{l=1}^Ke^{\sum_{m=0}^M\beta_{ml}\sigma(\alpha_{0m} + \|\alpha_m\|(\omega_m^TX))}}.\non
	\end{equation} 
	
    Note that $\sum_{k=1}^Kf_k(X) = 1$. Instead of model $f_k(X)$, it's more convenient to model the log ratio $\log(f_k(X)/f_K(X))$, which is then simplified to

    \begin{equation}
	  	\sum_{m=0}^M(\beta_{km}-\beta_{Km})\sigma(\alpha_{0m} + \|\alpha_m\|(\omega_m^TX)),\non
    \end{equation}

    which is in the PPR form of (11.1).
