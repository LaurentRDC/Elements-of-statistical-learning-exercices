???+ question "Ex. 12.7"
    Derive the solution to the penalized optimal scoring problem (12.57).

??? done "Soln. 12.7"
    The idea to solve the *penalized* optimal scoring problem (12.57) is essentially the same as that in [Ex. 12.6](ex12-06.md), we only need to change $\bb{S}$ from $\bb{H}(\bb{H}^T\bb{H})^{-1}\bb{H}^T$ to $\bb{H}(\bb{H}^T\bb{H}+\Omega)^{-1}\bb{H}^T$.
