???+ question "Ex. 12.1"
    Show that the criteria (12.25) and (12.8) are equivalent.    

??? done "Soln. 12.1"
	For (12.8), the problem (denoted as $P_1$) is
	
    \begin{eqnarray}
	\label{eq:12-1a}
		P_1: &&\min_{\beta, \beta_0}\ \ \  \frac{1}{2} \|\beta\|^2 + C\sum_{i=1}^N\xi_i \non \\
		&&\text{subject to} \ \ \ \xi_i\ge 0, \ \xi_i \ge 1 - y_if(x_i) \ \forall i\non
	\end{eqnarray}

	For (12.25), the problem (denoted as $P'_2$) with $\lambda=\frac{1}{C}$ is
	
    \begin{eqnarray}
	\label{eq:12-1b}
		P'_2: &&\min_{\beta, \beta_0}\ \ \ \frac{1}{C}\left[ \frac{1}{2} \|\beta\|^2 + C\sum_{i=1}^N\eta_i \right]\non \\
		&&\text{subject to} \ \ \ \eta_i = [1-y_if(x_i)]_+ \ \forall i\non
	\end{eqnarray}

	The objective functions for both problems are the same, up to constant $\frac{1}{C}$. Without loss of generality, we rewrite $P'_2$ as $P_2$: 
	
    \begin{eqnarray}
	\label{eq:12-1bb}
		P_2: &&\min_{\beta, \beta_0}\ \ \ \frac{1}{2} \|\beta\|^2 + C\sum_{i=1}^N\eta_i \non \\
		&&\text{subject to} \ \ \ \eta_i = [1-y_if(x_i)]_+ \ \forall i\non
	\end{eqnarray}

	For any optimal solution $\{\hat\beta, \hat\beta_0, \hat\eta_i\}$ of $P_2$, it also satisfies the constraints in $P_1$, because $\hat\eta_i=[1-y_i\hat f(x_i)]_+\ge 0$ and $\hat\eta_i=[1-y_i\hat f(x_i)]_+\ge 1-y_i\hat f(x_i)$ for any $i$. Therefore, we know the optimal value of $P_2$ is greater than or equal to that of $P_1$.

	To show the other way around, let's go back to (12.10) - (12.16) in the text which uniquely characterize the solution to $P_1$. Consider an optimal solution $\{\hat\beta, \hat\beta_0, \hat\xi_i\}$ of $P_1$. If $\hat\xi_i > 1-y_i\hat f(x_i)$, then $\hat\alpha_i=0$ by (12.14), and $C-\mu_i=0$ by (12.12), so that $\xi_i$ is eliminated in (12.9). In other words, the $i$-th data sample is not a *support vector*. Such $\hat\xi_i$ have no impact on the optimal solution, therefore the focus is on $\hat\xi_i = 1-y_i\hat f(x_i) = [1-y_i\hat f(x_i)]_+ = \hat \eta_i$ since $\hat \xi_i\ge 0$. This reduces to constraints in $P_2$.

	Therefore, the two problems have the same solution.
