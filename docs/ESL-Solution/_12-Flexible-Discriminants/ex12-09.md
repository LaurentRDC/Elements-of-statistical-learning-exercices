???+ question "Ex. 12.9"
    Let $\hat{\bb{Y}}=\bb{X}\hat{\bb{B}}$ be the fitted $N\times K$ indicator response matrix after linear regression on the $N\times p$ matrix $\bb{X}$, where $p > K$. Consider the reduced features $x_i^\ast = \hat{\bb{B}}^Tx_i$. Show that LDA using $x_i^\ast$ is equivalent to LDA in the original space.

    This is the same as [Ex. 4.3](../4-Linear-Methods-for-Classification/ex4-3.md).
