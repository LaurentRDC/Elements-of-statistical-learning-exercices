???+ question "Ex. 14.10"
	Derive the solution to the affine-invariant average problem (14.60). Apply it to the three Sâ€™s, and compare the results to those computed in Exercise 14.9.

??? done "Soln. 14.10"
 	We need to solve the problem 

	\begin{equation}
		\min_{\{\bb{A}_l\}_1^L, \bb{M}}\sum_{l=1}^N\|\bX_l\bb{A}_l - \bM\|_F^2,\non
	\end{equation}

	where $\bA_l$ are $p\times p$ nonsingular matrices and $\bM^T\bM = \bb{I}$.

	The Lagrangian for the problem is 

	\begin{eqnarray}
		L(\bA_l, \bM, \bA) &=& \sum_{l=1}^L\text{trace}[(\bA_l^T\bX_l^T-\bM^T)(\bA_l\bX_l-\bM)] + \text{trace}[\bA(\bM^T\bM-\bb{I})].\non
	\end{eqnarray}

	Taking derivative w.r.t $\bA_l$ and setting it to be zero we have

	\begin{eqnarray}
		\frac{\partial L(\bA_l, \bM, \bA)}{\partial \bA_l} &=& 2(\bX_l^T\bX_l\bA_l - \bX_l^T\bM)=0,\non
	\end{eqnarray}

	thus we know $\bA_l = (\bX_l^T\bX_l)^{-1}\bX_l\bM$. Denote $\bb{H}_l = \bX_l(\bX_l^T\bX_l)^{-1}\bX_l$, and plug the solution for $\bA_l$ into the original problem, it reduces to minimize

	\begin{eqnarray}
		&&\sum_{l=1}^L \text{trace}[\bM^T(\bb{H}_l^T-\bb{I})(\bb{H}_l-\bb{I})\bM]\non\\
		&=&\sum_{l=1}^L\text{trace}[\bM^T(\bb{I}-\bb{H}_l)\bM]\non\\
		&=&L\text{trace}\left[\bM^T\bM - \bM^T\bar{\bb{H}}\bM\right]\non\\
		&=&Lq - L\text{trace}[\bM^T\bar{\bb{H}}\bM].
	\end{eqnarray}

	Now we see the problem reduces to 

	\begin{equation}
		\max_{\bM} \text{trace}[\bM^T\bar{\bb{H}}\bM]
	\end{equation}

	under the condition that $\bM^T\bM = \bb{I}$. The optimal solution is achieved when $\bM$ is an orthogonal basis of the eigenspace associated with the largest eigenvalues of $\bar{\bb{H}}$. That is, $\bM$ is the $N\times p$ matrix formed from the $p$ largest eigenvectors of $\bar{\bb{H}}$. The proof follows directly from Courant-Fisher characterization. 

	We give a short proof here. Consider the Lagrangian again and taking derivatives w.r.t $\bM$, we get

	\begin{equation}
		\bar{\bb{H}}\bM = \bM \bar{\bb{A}},\non
	\end{equation}
	
    for some symmetric $\bar{\bb{A}}$. This is an *invariant subspace* equation. The equations allow $\bM$ to be an arbitrary orthogonal basis for the rank-$p$ subspace. It's then clear the choice of $\bM$ described earlier is an optimal solution.
