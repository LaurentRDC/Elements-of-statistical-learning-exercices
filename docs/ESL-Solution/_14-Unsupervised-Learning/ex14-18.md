???+ question "Ex. 14.18"
	Consider the regularized log-likelihood for the density estimation problem arising in ICA,

	\begin{equation}
		\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N[\log(\phi(s_i))+g(s_i)] - \int \phi(t)e^{g(t)}dt - \lambda \int \{g^{'''}(t)\}^2dt.\non
	\end{equation}
	
    The solution $\hat g$ is a quartic smoothing spline, and can be written as $\hat g(s) = \hat q(s) + \hat{q}_\bot (s)$, where q is a quadratic function (in the null space of the penalty). Let $q(s) = \theta_0 + \theta_1s + \theta_2s^2$. By examining the stationarity conditions for $\theta^k$, $k = 1, 2, 3$, show that the solution $\hat f = \phi e^{\hat g}$ is a density, and has mean zero and variance one. If we used a second-derivative penalty $\int \{g^{''}(t)\}^2(t)dt$ instead, what simple modification could we make to the problem to maintain the three moment conditions?

	Considering the stationarity condition, if we differentiate the log-likelihood w.r.t to $\theta_0$, we should get zero at the optimal value $\hat\theta_0$. By the assumption of $\hat g(s)$, the differential is
	
    \begin{equation}
		1 - \int \phi(t)e^{\hat g(t)} dt = 0,\non
	\end{equation}
	
    therefore we know $\hat f= \phi e^{\hat g}$ is a density.

	Similarly for $\theta_1$, the differential is
	
    \begin{equation}
		\bar s - \int \phi(t)e^{\hat g(t)}tdt=0-\text{mean}(\hat f)=0,\non
	\end{equation}
	
    since $S$ is assumed to have zero mean. 

	At last, for $\theta_2$, the differential is 
	
    \begin{equation}
		\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^Ns_i^2 - \int \phi(t)e^{\hat g(t)}t^2dt=0.\non
	\end{equation}
	
    Since both $S$ and $\hat f$ have zero mean, we know that the variance of $\hat f$ equals the variance of $S$, which is assumed to be 1.

	If we use a second-derivative penalty instead, then $\hat g$ becomes a cubic smoothing spline, and the first two conditions ($\hat f$ is a density and has zero mean) are still preserved via the same arguments above. We can modify the problem by adding a Lagrangian multiplier to accommodate the constraint for the variance.
