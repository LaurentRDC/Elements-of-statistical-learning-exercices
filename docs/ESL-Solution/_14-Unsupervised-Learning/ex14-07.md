???+ question "Ex. 14.7"
    Derive (14.51) and (14.52) in Section 14.5.1. Show that $\hat\mu$ is not unique, and characterize the family of equivalent solutions.

??? done "Soln. 14.7"
	We need to miminize the *reconstruction error*

	\begin{equation}
		\min_{\mu, \{\lambda_i\}, \bb{V}_q} \sum_{i=1}^N\|x_i-\mu-\bb{V}_q\lambda_i\|^2.\non
	\end{equation}

	Taking derivatives w.r.t to $\mu$ and $\lambda_i$ and setting them to zero, we get

	\begin{eqnarray}
		&&\sum_{i=1}^N(x_i-\mu-\bb{V}_q\lambda_i) = 0\non\\
		&&\bb{V}_q^T(x_i-\mu-\bb{V}_q\lambda_i) = 0.\non
	\end{eqnarray}

	Since $\bb{V}_q^T\bb{V}_q = \bb{I}$, from the condition on $\lambda_i$ we have

	\begin{equation}
		\lambda_i = \bb{V}_q^T(x_i-\mu),\non
	\end{equation}

	and we plug this into the condition for $\mu$ and we get

	\begin{equation}
		(\bb{I} - \bb{V}_q\bb{V}_q^T)\sum_{i=1}^N(x_i-\mu) = 0.\non
	\end{equation}

	Therefore, we see that 

	\begin{eqnarray}
		\hat\mu &=& \bar x\non\\
		\hat\lambda_i &=&\bb{V}_q^T(x_i-\bar x)\non
	\end{eqnarray}

	is a set of optimized solutions, however not unique. The family of equivalent solutions is characterized by the set of $\hat\mu$ that yields $\sum_{i=1}^N(x_i-\hat\mu)$ lying in the null space of $(\bb{I} - \bb{V}_q\bb{V}_q^T)$.
