???+ question "Ex. 7.10"
    Referring to the example in Section 7.10.3, suppose instead that all of the $p$ predictors are binary, and hence there is no need to estimate split points. The predictors are independent of the class labels as before. Then if $p$ is very large, we can probably find a predictor that splits the entire training data perfectly, and hence would split the validation data (one-fifth of data) perfectly as well. This predictor would therefore have zero cross-validation error. Does this mean that cross-validation does not provide a good estimate of test error in this situation? [This question was suggested by Li Ma.]
