???+ question "Ex. 16.2"
	Let $\alpha(t)\in\mathbb{R}^p$ be a piecewise-differentiable and continuous coefficient profile, with $\alpha(0)=0$. The $L_1$ arc-length of $\alpha$ from time 0 to $t$ is defined by 
	
    \begin{equation}
		\Lambda(t) = \int_0^t |\dot{\alpha}(s)|_1ds.\non
	\end{equation}
	
    Show that $\Lambda(t)\ge |\alpha(t)|_1$, with equality iff $\alpha(t)$ is monotone.

??? done "Soln. 16.2"
	The inequality follows directly by noting 
	
    \begin{equation}
		\alpha(t) = \int_0^t\dot{\alpha}(s)ds.\non
	\end{equation}
	
    When $\alpha(t)$ is monotone, we know that $\dot{\alpha(s)}$ is either non-positive or non-negative, so that the equality holds. 

	On the other hand, suppose that equality holds but $\alpha(t)$ is not monotone. Without loss of generality, we may assume that there exist $0 < t_1 < t$ such that $\alpha(t_1) > \alpha(0)$ and $\alpha(t_1) > \alpha(t)$. It is then not difficult (via classical real analysis alike arguments) to show that $\Lambda(t) > |\alpha(t)|_1$, which is a contradiction.
