???+ question "Ex. 15.6"
	Fit a series of random-forest classifiers to the *spam* data, to explore the sensitivity to the parameter $m$. Plot both the oob error as well as the test error against a suitably chosen range of values for $m$.

??? done "Soln. 15.6"
    Figure 1 below shows the sensitivity to the parameter $m$, whose values are chosen from 1 to $\sqrt{p}\approx 8$ (the square root of the number of variables). We see that OOB errors are consistent greater than test errors but have a similar trend.
